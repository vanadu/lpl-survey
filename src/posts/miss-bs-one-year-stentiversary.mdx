## +570 Days of Bonus Time with Miss B!

<span className="semibold">UPDATE 4/9/2024</span>: Miss B is now close to 16 years old. She got her stent 570 days ago and counting. Our brutally hot and humid East Coast summer is approaching and it&lsquo;s anyone&lsquo;s guess whether she&lsquo;ll survive it. But she&lsquo;s had an bonus year and a half of love and life thanks to a two inch piece of medical-grade silicone, and for that we are grateful.

<span className="semibold">9/9/2023</span>: Three-hundred sixty five is an arbitrary number. But it's significant for Miss B and me because it moves her into the statistical category of 'lived &gt; 1 years after...' Truth be told, I didn't expect her to live this long. Considering that Miss B was well over 14 years old with noticeable hind-end polyneuropathy 365 days ago, the fact that she's still alive with a good quality of life is quite a feat.

Miss B is probably well over 15 now. I got her in 2009 from a county pound in Georgia, so I'm not exactly sure how old she is. Sometimes she needs a lift getting up, and storms make her so agitated that I sometimes have to calm her down with trazodone. When I let her out to potty, sometimes she stands the
re like she's not sure what she's supposed to be doing. I first noticed this change in her behavior several months ago. I call it ARF-heimers, but the official term is <a href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments/riney-canine-health-center/canine-health-information/cognitive-dysfunction-syndrome" className="link-dark" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canine cognitive dysfunction syndrome</a> or CDS. I don't love her any less and it doesn't make her life any less worth living. It just means she requires a little more care and consideration, something I'm more than willing to give for the companionship and devotion she has given me over the past 14 years. 



Miss B still gnaws blissfully at her marrow-bone a few times a week and still loves to walk and sometimes even run short distances with her Goldendoodle neighbor Farley. I know it's a matter of time before I have to let her go, but this last +569 days has given Miss B the opportunity for a life not prematurely terminated by laryngeal paralysis. She won't suffocate to death or have to deal with the trauma of a legacy 20th century surgical procedure, and for that I'm very grateful. Even with her CDS, every day after September 9, 2022 with Miss B has been a blessing, one that every LarPar dog and their human companions deserve.
