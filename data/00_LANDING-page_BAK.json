If your companion has recently crossed over the Rainbow Bridge, maybe it's best to do the survey later when you've had time to heal.</p><p>First, we'll explain what information we'll collect and how we'll ensure your privacy and data security. Then we'll ask for your consent to continue the survey. If at that point, you feel like talking about it would open too many wounds, we encourage you to stop and come back later when when you're ready.</p>"
